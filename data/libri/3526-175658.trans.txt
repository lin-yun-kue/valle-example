3526-175658-0011 BUT THE GENERAL EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHILLING HAD NOT A SECOND LARGE PAIR OF FOLDING DOORS STANDING WIDE OPEN AND DISCLOSING ANOTHER AND SMALLER SALON MORE SNUGLY FURNISHED OFFERED SOME RELIEF TO THE EYE
3526-175658-0012 THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
3526-175658-0013 WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
3526-175658-0014 FOR I AM NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET
3526-175658-0015 YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
3526-175658-0016 BUT YOU SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING
3526-175658-0017 COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
3526-175658-0018 NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE
3526-175658-0019 IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
3526-175658-0020 WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
3526-175658-0021 WHO MIGHT INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT IN CURLS
3526-175658-0022 PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
3526-175658-0023 WAS IT SAGACITY SENSE YES I THOUGHT SO BUT I COULD SCARCELY AS YET BE SURE I DISCOVERED HOWEVER
3526-175658-0024 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
3526-175658-0025 AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF
3526-175658-0026 WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
3526-175658-0027 THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
3526-175658-0028 AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
3526-175658-0029 BEFORE THE NEGOTIATION WAS COMPLETED IT BEGAN TO GROW A LITTLE DUSK I DID NOT HASTEN IT FOR I LIKED WELL ENOUGH TO SIT AND HEAR HER TALK I WAS AMUSED WITH THE SORT OF BUSINESS TALENT SHE DISPLAYED EDWARD COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIMSELF MORE PRACTICAL
3526-175658-0030 THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
3526-175658-0031 BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
3526-175658-0032 ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN THE TWILIGHT SOFTENED HER FEATURES A LITTLE AND IN THE DOUBTFUL DUSK I COULD FANCY HER FOREHEAD AS OPEN AS IT WAS REALLY ELEVATED HER MOUTH TOUCHED WITH TURNS OF SWEETNESS AS WELL AS DEFINED IN LINES OF SENSE
3526-175658-0033 WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID AH
3526-175658-0034 AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
3526-175658-0035 AND IT APPEARED AS IF SOME CHEERFUL EVENTFUL UPWARD TENDING CAREER WERE EVEN THEN OPENING TO ME ON THAT SELFSAME MILD STILL APRIL NIGHT
